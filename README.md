# odin-recipes
Project is done hoooray!!

This project is about building a recipes website as part of theodinproject curriculum in which i have to demonstrate the skills
and knowledge about html,git and github up to this project.

Update: i just finished the project it was simple and so much fun it took me plenty of time than i had intended 90 percent of the time spent was figuring out when's a great time to commit a message andhow to write a proper one hopefully i'll figure how to do so in the upcoming projects overall great work!.

ps: i added a gif of makima in the homepage cuz why not :D
