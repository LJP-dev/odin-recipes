        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken, giblets removed</li>
            <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon onion powder, or to taste</li>
            <li>Â½ cup butter</li>
            <li>1 stalk celery, leaves removed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        
        <ol>
            <li>preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degreesC).</li><br>

            <li>Place chicken in a roasting pan; season generously inside and 
                out with onion powder, salt, and pepper. Place 3 tablespoons <br> of
                butter in chicken cavity; arrange dollops of remaining butter on
                the outside of chicken. Cut celery into 3 or 4 pieces;<br> place in 
                the chicken cavity.</li><br>

            <li>Bake chicken uncovered in the preheated oven until no longer 
                pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour and 15 
                minutes.<br> An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest
                part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F 
                (74 degrees C).</li><br>

            <li>Remove from the oven and baste with drippings. Cover with aluminum
                foil and allow to rest for about 30 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
